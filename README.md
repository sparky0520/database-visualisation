# Database Visualisation using React/Flask

### Through this full stack application the admin will be able to manage a database (MySQL) and perform the following tasks:


- Add Employee: Adding name, position, salary. A unique id is automatically generated with every next id being an increment of the previous.

- Delete Employee: Taking complete data i.e. employee_id, name, position and salary to delete the record ensuring the correct record is deleted.

- Update Employee: Taking employee_id to change a specific record along with the new data : name, position, salary to update the record.

- View Records: Clicking on "View Database" we can see all the records in a neatly aligned table in a new page. In this new page we can filter records by name or salary of the employee. All the records with data like the filter will appear in the table.




# Backend - Flask App
The backend server comprises of a flask script, blueprint file and database code file all of which are written in Python.
